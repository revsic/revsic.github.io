Hi, I'm Young Joong Kim, a TTS Machine learning researcher at [LionRocket](https://lionrocket.ai).

안녕하세요, [라이언로켓](https://lionrocket.ai)에서 TTS 머신러닝 리서치를 맡고 있는 김영중입니다.

I'm working on the Text-To-Speech deep learning system and optimizing the inference module by the CUDA C++ framework.

저는 Text-To-Speech 딥러닝 시스템 관련 연구를 진행하고, CUDA C++ 프레임워크를 통해 inference 모듈을 최적화하는 일을 하고 있습니다.

I'm interested in Bayesian methodology and TTS system, and also following the recent papers from Reddit, etc.

베이지안 방법론과 TTS 시스템에 관심이 있으며, 레딧 등을 통해 최신 논문들을 따라가고 있습니다.
